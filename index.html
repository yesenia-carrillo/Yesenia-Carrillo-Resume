        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science/Administration</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently Yesenia is a caretaker and in this position she practices all the skills she has acquired over the past few years. She is passionate, determined and positive about 
        the opportunities that lay ahead of her. She is interested in all aspects of care taking and providing assistance to not only the elderly but to the family that is providing the financial support.
        She is not only a caretaker but she has also found other equally passionate individuals that are extremely qualified to work as caretakers. Yesenia has helped others find jobs, apply for them, and 
        prepare them so that they can stand out and get the job. She sees a problem and looks for the solution. Yesenia views her surroundings and then looks at her own connections and resources and tries to help businesses and individuals 
        be more efficient and successful either by providing businesses with new hard working employees or by providing businesses with new clients. She hopes to continue helping businesses in as many ways as she can all while also helping 
        individuals find jobs that best fit with their own goals and aspirations.<br><br>

        Yesenia Carrillo is nineteen years old. She graduated from high school in 2019 with a 4.0. She was extremely involved in her community through clubs and organizations like Rotary and Interact club. Yesenia played 
        tennis for four years which allowed her to grow as a team player and as a leader. Yesenia is currently a second year Political Science/Administration major at the University of California Riverside where she plans
        on allowing her curiosity of the finance world to integrate into her current studies. She continues to help those in her community through informing, educating and assisting with tasks such as applying for jobs, helping others 
        speak on community issues,even paying important bills online, and translating important paper work.<br><br>

       Yesenia has lead many events in her community such as the American Red Cross Blood drive, Church events, and neighborhood cleanups. She has attended city council meetings and has spoken for the youth in her community all while 
        balancing her school work and personal responsibilities. She has held leadership roles such as representative in multiple clubs and activities but her leadership is seen in everything she does. In high school she took an extra class 
        that taught her how to use the 10 key adding machine, how to write checks, and how to prepare for interviews. She learned about credit, debt and how to use them to her advantage. Yesenia was able to practice what she learned in this class 
        when she obtained an internship at an insurance brokerage. She has also worked independently helping local businesses with calling and looking for the best offers that will benefit them. This class taught her much about the "real world" and 
        how to analyze her own knowledge and skills, how to identify what her strengths and weaknesses are and how to improve herself along with those around her that need some assistance.<br><br>
